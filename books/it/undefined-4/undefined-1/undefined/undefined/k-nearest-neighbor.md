# K-Nearest Neighbor 모델

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

￼ㅎ

#### Steps:

1. Choose the number of neighbors ( k ).
2. Find the ( k ) nearest neighbors of the new data point.
3. Determine the most common class among these neighbors.
4. Assign the class to the new data point.

#### Pros:

* Simple and easy to understand.
* No training phase required.

#### Cons:

* Computationally expensive for large datasets.
* Performance depends on the choice of ( k ) and distance metric.
