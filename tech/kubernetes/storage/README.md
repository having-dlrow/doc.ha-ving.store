NAME: openebs
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jun 21 16:26:02 2024
NAMESPACE: openebs
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Successfully installed OpenEBS.

Check the status by running: kubectl get pods -n openebs

The default values will install NDM and enable OpenEBS hostpath and device
storage engines along with their default StorageClasses. Use `kubectl get sc`
to see the list of installed OpenEBS StorageClasses.

**Note**: If you are upgrading from the older helm chart that was using cStor
and Jiva (non-csi) volumes, you will have to run the following command to include
the older provisioners:

helm upgrade openebs openebs/openebs \
        --namespace openebs \
        --set legacy.enabled=true \
        --reuse-values

For other engines, you will need to perform a few more additional steps to
enable the engine, configure the engines (e.g. creating pools) and create 
StorageClasses. 

For example, cStor can be enabled using commands like:

helm upgrade openebs openebs/openebs \
        --namespace openebs \
        --set cstor.enabled=true \
        --reuse-values

-----------------------

When using OpenEBS with a single node MicroK8s, it is recommended to use the openebs-hostpath StorageClass
